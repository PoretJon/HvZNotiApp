# HvZ Noti Application

This application is my attempt to stop myself from staring at my school's Humans Vs Zombies website while I'm in class by having notifications sent to both my discord account and my phone. 

## Main Goals
This application is relatively simple and requires performs the following tasks:
* Obtain the number of humans and zombies during the game
* Determine the ratio of humans to zombies
* Send notifications to my pushover account once certain ratios are hit

## Tech Stack

This application is going to be built mostly using python. I may attempt to rewrite it in rust at some point to learn rust, but since I am making this the weekend before the weeklong game starts, I am going to stick with what I know for now.

As of right now, the only external library used is mechanicalsoup.
